        Taking a test on coding is awesome 
for many reasons!!!
        I like to write in paragraph format.
        The following horizontal rule should
be centered,
         a size of 10 and a width of 86.
         The horizontal rule below is a width
of 50%.
       </p>
       
       <hr width="86%" size="10"
align="center">
